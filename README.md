# PP_Assignments
Assignments for the Programming Paradigms Course at the Faculty of Automatic 
Control and Computers from the "Politehnica" University of Bucharest.

## Assignments

### RacketAtTheSupermarket

This assignment involved building a simulation of a supermarket checkout 
system using user-defined data structure, lazy evaluation, and inifinte structures.

### MobileTargetSearch

This assignment involved building a simulation of a game inspired by the game 
*Amongus*. The game is represented by a 2D board with a hunter, targets, 
bidirectional portals and obstacles. The goal of the game is for the hunter to 
capture all the targets. The movement can only be done by one position at a 
time in any of the four cardinal directions. The game uses an implementation 
of the `A* (A Star)` search algorithm to traverese the state space and determine 
the best move for the hunter. This assignment was built in Haskell.
